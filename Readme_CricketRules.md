This game is going to play one inning of one over each from players. Each over includes 6 bowls.
On each bowl either the player can score something or gets out and score ZERO.

At the end of the innings i.e. 12 balls the dicission will be made based on the highest score. We can incorporate more rules and conditions based on the need. As of now this is deciding the winner based on total score.

On the begining of inning/game there will be an animated ball dropped to the level of bat. This is just an attempt to produce some animation in the website.
